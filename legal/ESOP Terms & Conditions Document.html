<p class=MsoTitleCxSpMiddle>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoTitleCxSpMiddle>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoTitleCxSpLast>Preamble</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>{company} (the “<b>Company</b>”) is a limited liability
company established and organised under the laws of {country}. The Company is registered
with {hrb-clause}.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Company is identified by the following address
{company-address} on Ethereum network. Ethereum network is a public distributed
ledger that allows to deploy self-enforcing contracts called smart contracts
and provides global consensus of contract enforcement outcomes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Company intends to enable its current and future
employees, freelancers, consultants and/or advisors (each an “<b>Employee</b>”)
to participate in its commercial success. Therefore, it may offer its Employees
the opportunity to acquire options in shares in the Company. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This participation of the Employees in the Company shall
take the form of an Employee Share Option Pool (the “<b>ESOP</b>”) under the
terms and conditions as set out in a smart contract under address {esop-sc-address}
(the “<b>ESOP Smart Contract</b>”). The ESOP Smart Contract source code is
available in repository {repo-url} with commit {commit-id} (the “<b>Repository</b>”)
and steps to verify EVM bytecode can be found in README.md file.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ESOP terms outlined in this document (the “<b>Terms</b>”)
correspond to the self-enforcing computer code of ESOP Smart Contract. In the
event of any discrepancies between the ESOP Smart Contract and the Terms, the
Terms shall prevail. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Terms define certain terms of conversion of Options (as
defined below). Such terms of conversion correspond to Base Options Conversion
Smart Contract the source code of which is available in the Repository. The
terms of conversion may be extended by an Options Conversion Smart Contract
which shall be derived from Base Options Conversion Smart Contract and shall be
offered to Employee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Acquisition of Options</h1>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.1<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Company may offer options to the Employees (the “<b>Option-Offer</b>”).
The Option-Offer to the Employee will be made through a certain <b>Subscription
Form</b> provided by Company to Employee. The Subscription Form shall directly
interface to Ethereum network and shall allow Employee to sign ESOP Smart
Contract with Employee’s <b>Private Key</b>. Private Key storage (“<b>Wallet</b>”)
shall be at Employee’s sole discretion. However, no Option-Offer shall be made
before Employee’s <b>Ethereum Address</b> is provided to Company.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.2<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>{options-per-share} options provide the right to acquire one ordinary
share in the nominal amount of EUR 1.00 (in words: Euro one) in the Company
(the “<b>Option</b>”) for the <b>Strike Price</b> of {strike-price} EUR.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.3<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Number of options granted to the Employee (“<b>Issued Options</b>”)
shall be determined by the algorithm pursuant to clause 2.1
and as further specified in the Subscription Form.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.4<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Employee shall accept the Option-Offer through signing the ESOP
Smart Contract with Employee’s Private Key under the date (“<b>Issue Date</b>”)
as specified in the Subscription form.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.5<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Any Option-Offer may only be accepted until a certain date as specified
in the Subscription Form which shall not be earlier than two weeks after the
Option-Offer has been made to Employee. Once expired an Option-Offer shall
become void.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.6<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The granting of Issued Options does not have any influence on the
calculation of possible bonus payments, pension plans or any other
compensations of the Employee. The Company grants the Issued Options on a
voluntary basis only; the Employee is not entitled to demand further Options.
No repeated grant of Options to an Employee shall be deemed to confer any
entitlement (under any company practice or otherwise) as to any (future) grant
of Options to any Employee or any third person or entity. </p>

</span>Vesting Mechanism of Options</a></h1>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><a name="_Ref481523605">2.1<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Options shall be issued pursuant to the following algorithm: Company
shall define a total number of “<b>Pool Options</b>” to be {pool-options} {the
“<b>Pool</b>”}. {new-employee-pool-share}% of total number of Pool Options in
the Pool shall be granted to Employee and then removed from the Pool. Each
subsequent beneficiary under the ESOP shall be offered
{new-employee-pool-share}% of the remaining options in the Pool .</a></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.2<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Company may grant to Employee additional “<b>Extra Options</b>” subject
to its sole discretion (together with the Pool Options the “<b>Issued Options</b>”).
Such grant may be offered to Employee multiple times at any date before
Conversion Notification or Work Termination. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.3<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Issued Options are subject to a vesting mechanism, i.e. an algorithm
determining the number of Issued Options qualified as vested options and only
as such becoming exercisable according to section 3 (the “<b>Vested Options</b>”).
The number of Vested Options shall be conditional on whether and when the
employment or service agreement between the Employee and the Company is terminated
or the Employee terminates working for the Company as a matter of fact (each a
“<b>Work Termination</b>”, the Employee in each case a “<b>Terminated Employee</b>”)
within a certain period of time after the Issue Date (the “<b>Vesting Period</b>”)
as specified in the Subscription Form. The remaining number of Issued Options
that will not become Vested Options or will be deemed not being Vested Options
(the “<b>Returned Options</b>”) shall return to the Pool.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.4<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The following methodology shall apply to determine the number of Vested
Options:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:1.0in'>2.4.1<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For a certain period commencing on the Issue Date (the “<b>Cliff Period</b>”),
as specified in the Subscription Form, no Issued Options shall become Vested
Options. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:1.0in'>2.4.2<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For the period commencing with the end of the Cliff Period and until the
end of the Vesting Period, the number of Vested Options increases up to the
total number of Issued Options on a linear daily basis at the end of each
calendar day at the corporate seat of the Company starting with the Issue Date.
</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:1.0in'>2.4.3<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In case of a Conversion Notification (as defined below) all Issued
Options shall be deemed Vested Options (the “<b>Accelerated Vesting</b>”) and
additional Bonus Options may be issued to Employee in a number as specified in
the Subscription Form. However, Bonus Options may only be granted if and when
at the date of the Conversion Notification no Work Termination has occurred and
only subject to Employee making further undertakings pursuant to clauses 3.4 and 3.6.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:1.0in'>2.4.4<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The expiry date of the Vesting Period, including the Cliff Period, shall
be extended for each and any calendar day which the employment, advisory or
service agreement of the Employee is suspended or during which the Company’s
obligation to pay a salary or any other compensation to the Employee is
suspended (for instance maternity leave, occupational disability, unpaid
sabbatical, illness, unpaid leave, exemption due to further education etc.) (a
“<b>Suspended Period</b>”).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:1.0in'>2.4.5<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For a certain period commencing at the date of the Work Termination (the
“<b>Termination Date</b>”) until a date that is the equal number of calendar
days after Termination Date as the Termination Date is after the Issue Date
(the “<b>Fade Out Period</b>”) , the number of Vested Options shall decrease
down to a number equaling a certain percentage of the Issued Options  as
specified in the Subscription Form (the “<b>Residual Amount</b>”) on a linear
daily basis at the end of each calendar day at the corporate seat of the
Company commencing with the Termination Date. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:1.0in'>2.4.6<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The number of Pool Options that was decreased down during the Fade Out
Period shall deemed non-vested and shall return to the Pool as a Returned
Option.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.5<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Returned Options shall be granted to all Employees that participated in
the ESOP subsequent to the Terminated Employee {new-employee-pool-share}% of
total number of Returned Options shall be granted to the first such subsequent
Employee and removed from Returned Options. Each next subsequent Employee shall
be granted {new-employee-pool-share}% of the remaining options of Returned
Options. Any remaining Returned Option (if any) shall be returned to the Pool.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.6<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Employee shall not be entitled to any Issued Options or Vested
Options if the employment, advisory or service agreement is terminated for
reasons for which the Employee is responsible (each case a “<b>Bad Leaver Event</b>”).
The Employee shall be regarded as responsible for any termination by the
Company for (good) cause. In a Bad Leaver Event the vesting mechanism shall not
apply and all Issued Options or Vested Options shall expire upon receipt of the
termination notice by the Employee or the Company, as applicable, without
entitlement to damages. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.7<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If in any calculation involving options any given result is not evenly
divisible by one, it shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number if the
decimal fraction value is less than 0.5, otherwise it shall be rounded up. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.1<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>An “<b>Conversion Event</b>” is any kind of transaction including any
transaction under a smart contract in which (i) shares collectively
constituting more than 50 % of the Company’s issued share capital are
purchased, exchanged or acquired in a financially comparable fashion in one transaction
or a series of transactions temporarily connected by a buyer and/or buyer
consortium (each a “<b>Buyer</b>”) (the “<b>Share Purchase</b>”), and/or; (ii)
the Company sells all or nearly all assets and/or IP rights (defined as more
than 50 % of all assets of the Company according to market value) of the
Company in one transaction or a series of transactions temporarily connected to
a Buyer (the “<b>Asset Purchase</b>”), and/or (iii) an IPO (Initial Public
Offering) of the shares of the Company takes place (the “<b>IPO</b>”); and/or
(iv) full or partial tokenization of the shares in the Company (the “<b>Share
Tokenization</b>”) through an Initial Coin Offering (“<b>ICO</b>”) takes place,
whereas “<b>Share Tokenization</b>” shall mean the representation of one or
more shareholders’ rights in the Company under a Smart Contract, in particular
but not limited to voting rights and entitlements to dividends and “<b>ICO</b>”
shall mean the first offering of a certain token on a multilateral trading
platform operated as a distributed ledger. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.2<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Details of the options conversion mechanism shall be defined in Options
Conversion Smart Contract provided at the time of Conversion Notification. In
connection with the Options Conversion Smart Contract Company may extend, but
not limit the definition of “Conversion Event”.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.3<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Company shall notify the Employee about an upcoming Conversion Event
at least two weeks in advance of the Conversion Event (the “<b>Conversion
Notification</b>”). The Conversion Notification shall include an offer to
Employee for signing Options Conversion Smart Contract with Employee’s Private
Key (the “<b>Conversion-Offer</b>”). Such Conversion-Offer shall be made
through <b>Options Conversion Form</b> which shall directly interface to
Ethereum blockchain. .</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><a name="_Ref481523703">3.4<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Options Conversion Form shall at minimum contain the following
provisions: (i) the number of the Employee’s Vested Options pursuant to section
</a>2; (ii) terms of a specific Conversion Event that shall be exercised via
Options Conversion Smart Contract; and (iii) <b>Accelerated Vesting and Bonus
Options Conditions</b>. The Conversion Offer may only be accepted within two
weeks after receipt if not provided otherwise in the Conversion Offer (the “<b>Exercise
Period</b>”).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.5<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Employee may only exercise the Vested Options within the Exercise
Period by providing information requested in the Options Conversion Form and
signing the Option Conversion Smart Contract with Employee’s Private Key.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><a name="_Ref481523709">3.6<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Company is obliged to assign the Bonus Options and Vested Options
that are based on the Accelerated Vesting (together the “<b>Accelerated Options</b>”)
only subject to the Employee’s consent to Accelerated Vesting and Bonus Options
Conditions. Such conditions may include but are not limited to (i) offer to
continue working for the Company (the “<b>Continued Work</b>”) for a certain
period after the Conversion Event as defined in the Conversion Offer (the “<b>Post
Conversion Period</b>”) and (ii) consenting that proceeds resulting from the
Conversion Event allocated to the Accelerated Options (the “<b>Additional
Payment</b>”) is held fiduciary for him and placed in an escrow account and
only be released to the Employee (a) at the end of the Post Conversion Period
or (b) after a Work Termination has occurred within the Post Conversion Period
if such Work Termination is not due to a Bad Leaver Event. In all other cases,
the Employee shall not be entitled to the Additional Payment. If the offer to
provide Continued Work was declined by the Company or the Buyer, as applicable,
the Accelerated Options shall be treated as regular Vested Options.</a></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><a name="_Ref481523721">3.7<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If the Company fails to provide the Conversion Notification and the
Employee does not exercise his Vested Options before the Conversion Event, the
respective Options will be deemed exercised according to the Conversion Options
Smart Contract. Accelerated Options will be added to Vested Options. If and
when the Exit Event occurs, the Employee will then be entitled towards the
Company to a compensation payment in the pro rata amount of the total proceeds
of the Exit Event (less the Strike Price) that would have been allocated to the
shares that would have been assigned to him if he had exercised the Vested
Options.</a></p>

</span>If the Employee fails to exercise his Vested Options within the Exercise
Period, the Company shall have the right to exercise such Vested Options (the “<b>Company´s
Exercise Right</b>”). If and when the Company exercises the Company´s Exercise
Right and an Conversion Event occurs, the Employee will be entitled towards the
Company to a compensation payment in the pro rata amount of the total proceeds
of the Exit Event (less the Strike Price) that would have been allocated to the
shares that would have been assigned to him if he had exercised the Vested
Options. If the Company’s Exercise Right is not exercised section 3.8 shall not apply.</p>

</span>Any Issued Options are under no circumstances transferable without the
Company’s prior written consent. The same applies to measures or actions, which
economically correspond to such a transfer (for instance trust or
sub-participation). In case any Issued Options are transferred without the
Company’s prior permission, they shall expire without any right to damages. </p>
